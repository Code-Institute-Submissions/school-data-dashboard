School Data Dashboard
----------------------

In this project I set out to create a data dashboard based on school exam results.

GCSE pupils sit exams in English, Maths, Science, History, Computer Science, Art and Food.
The results are then analysed by gender, by cohort, and by age and attendance for boys and girls
using bar charts.

Then the results are put into bar charts for each subject so that a comparison can be made
between genders, cohort, age and attendance.

Finally the results are analysed to find correlation between two variables.

Set up of graphs
----------------
Had to read in my data using crossfilter ndx
Then had to set up graph on screen using chaining in my js code in my function
Each graph followed the same process:
i) create a div
ii) create a function
iii) render the graph in the div.
